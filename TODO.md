- [x] Update `/register/initiate` endpoint in `routes/auth.js` to handle user existence checks and OTP sending based on verification status
- [x] Update `/login` endpoint in `routes/auth.js` to handle user existence, verification status, and OTP sending if not verified
- [x] Add debug logging in register, login, and OTP functions
